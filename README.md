# Master-s-Thesis-Code-Base
CodeBase for Master's Thesis. Models contains the non-linear and linear models used. The EMPC folder contains the code that implements the OTP algorithm and the NN Hyperparameter tuning. 

The construct_OCP folder contains the code that implements hhe OCP for the MPC implementation. The Simulink Model "Simulink_MPC_Main.slx" contains all the additional elements discussed in the Thesis. To run it, run "Prepare_MPC_005.m" first and then the Simulink model using the Real Time Desktop execution. 

Make sure to add the while directory to the path before executions.
